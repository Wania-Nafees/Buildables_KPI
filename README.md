# Buildables_KPI
This project explores how to define, calculate, and analyze Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using the Superstore dataset. The goal is to connect raw metrics (sales, profit, orders, customers) to meaningful KPIs that drive business insights.

Features:
This project demonstrates how raw business data can be transformed into actionable insights through KPI analysis. It covers the calculation of essential business metrics such as total sales, total orders, total customers, and profit margin, while also defining SMART KPIs like average order value and monthly sales growth. The analysis further includes building visualizations such as monthly sales trends, sales by region, and top products by revenue, along with identifying the most profitable customer segments. In addition, the project highlights underperforming areas and provides practical business recommendations, all of which are consolidated into a one-page KPI dashboard and executive summary for decision-making.

Tools Used: Google Sheets (KPI formulas, charts, and dashboard)
